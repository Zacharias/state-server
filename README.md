### Running this solution locally

#### Method 1. Docker

Easiest way to build/run this application is run `docker-compose up --build`. If you don't have compose (but have Docker somehow, which is getting more edge-casey by the version), you can run `docker build .` and docker run from there.


#### Method 2. dotnet

Dotnet apis have an in-built http server for web code, mostly (but not entirely) for development.
